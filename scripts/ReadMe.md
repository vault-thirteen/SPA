# Scripts

This folder contains installation scripts for the _SPA_ bundle.

These scripts must be used outside the repository folder, in a folder where 
you wish to install the _SPA_ bundle. This means that you must first copy these 
scripts to a folder where you plan to install the _SPA_ bundle, and then run them 
in that separate folder. 

These scripts do not use the source folder while they fetch all data from the 
Internet.
