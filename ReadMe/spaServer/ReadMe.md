# SPA Server

An HTTP server for a single page application in JavaScript.

An example of an index HTML page, a loader in JavaScript and a CSS style sheet 
are included. A favicon file using the PNG format is also included for 
reference.

## Building
Use the `build.bat` script included with the source code.

## Installation
`go install github.com/vault-thirteen/SPA/cmd/spaServer@latest`  

## Startup Parameters

### Server

`spaServer.exe <path-to-configuration-file>`  
`spaServer.exe`  

Example:

`spaServer.exe "settings.txt"`  
`spaServer.exe`  

**Notes:**  
If the path to a configuration file is omitted, the default one is used.  
Default name of the configuration file is `settings.txt`.  

## Settings

Format of the settings' file for a server is quite simple. It uses line breaks 
as a separator between parameters. Described below are meanings of each line.

1. Server's hostname.
2. Server's listen port.
3. Work mode: HTTP or HTTPS.
4. Path to the certificate file for the HTTPS work mode.
5. Path to the key file for the HTTPS work mode.
6. TTL of served files, i.e. value of the `max-age` field of the 
`Cache-Control` HTTP header.
7. Allowed origin for HTTP CORS, i.e. value of the 
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP header.
8. List of the cached files related to the JavaScript single page 
application, except the index HTML page which is hardcoded â€“ a JavaScript 
loader script, a CSS style sheet and a favicon file.

**Notes:**  
This server is an SPA server. This means that it does not serve ordinary 
data files having the contents of the whole website. It serves only those files 
which are required to start the JavaScript SPA itself and no more.

## Links Format

Links in the JSON data files must not start with a slash symbol.  
Slash symbol is automatically inserted by the JavaScript router.  
The same rule works for icons.
