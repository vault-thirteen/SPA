This example includes data obtained from the IP2Location LITE database.
Source: https://lite.ip2location.com.
The source file was slightly modified in following ways:
	1.	Lines with empty country were standardized for the reader.
	2.	Double quote symbol may not be removed while some country names
		contain commas and such a removal would break the CSV format.
